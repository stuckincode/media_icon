# media_icon
Little JS chanllenge that I did but code it in jQuery.

This was a course I did on lynda.com with Ray Villalobos. 
The Challenge was to make a function that took a javaScript object of media icon and make a function to automaticaly
put icons the page without having to write the html mark up each times.
